//here  1st we add code to allow user to open device camera and take picture
//2nd show preivew of image which was taken
//3rd pass this image back to add_places.dart screen so there to place detail screen
//4th add this picture to  model place.dart and riverpod places_list.dart

//ðŸ§¾after using some Native Device Feature we shold restart or rebild the project/ide
